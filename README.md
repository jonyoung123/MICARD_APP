The MiCard app is the new way of sharing and obtaining valuable business leads. Keep a clean digital version of your business card on you all the time. Share your digital business card with others via multiple platforms. Email, SMS, Social Media. Never miss an opportunity by easily capturing leads as you share.

Users can interact with you directly through your digital business card by being able to WhatsApp you or call you without having your number physically stored on their device. Users can download your contact (.vcf) onto their device at a touch of a button.
